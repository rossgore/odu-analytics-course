The dataset contains information on prices of diamonds, as well as various attributes of diamonds, some of which are known to influence their price (in 2008 $s): the 4 Cs (carat, cut, color, and clarity) , as well as some physical measurements (depth, table, price,  x, y, and z). The figure below shows what these measurements represent. x, y and z refer to length, width and depth.

Carat is a unit of mass equal to 200 mg and is used for measuring gemstones and pearls. Cut grade is is an objective measure of a diamondâ€™s light performance, or, what we generally think of as sparkle.

Clarity refers to the grading of diamonds and is ordered from most clear to least clear as follows: IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1


A data frame with 53940 rows and 10 variables:

price
price in US dollars (\$326--\$18,823)

carat
weight of the diamond (0.2--5.01)

cut
quality of the cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal)

color
diamond colour, from J (worst) to D (best)

clarity
a measurement of how clear the diamond is (I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best))

x
length in mm (0--10.74)

y
width in mm (0--58.9)

z
depth in mm (0--31.8)

depth
total depth percentage = z / mean(x, y) = 2 * z / (x + y) (43--79)

table
width of top of diamond relative to widest point (43--95)
