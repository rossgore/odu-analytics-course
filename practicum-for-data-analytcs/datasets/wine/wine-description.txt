Title: Wine Quality 


Relevant Information:

   The datasets is related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.
   For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].
   Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables 
   are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.).

   These datasets can be viewed as classification or regression tasks.
   There are munch more normal wines than excellent or poor ones). 
   Classifiers could be used to detect the few excellent
   or poor wines. Also, you could check if all input variables are relevant to such a classification. 

   Number of Instances: red wine - 1599; white wine - 4898. 

  Number of Attributes: 13
  
   Note: several of the attributes may be correlated.
